# tsuki

A programming language that focuses on being fun to program in, and aiding developers in writing more robust software, all while maintaining high performance.

The compiler is still in its infancy, and it'll probably take me a while before it's actually usable. In the meantime, you can check out the [spec](spec.md), which lays out the general feature set and vision of the language.

### Nim version

tsuki used to be an embeddable scripting language for Nim. I'm bad with coming up with names, and the old tsuki wasn't finished anyways, so I decided to reuse the name for this new project. The overall syntax is similar, with minor tweaks and the addition of static typing (and features related to it).

If you'd like to check out the source code of the Nim version, it's kept on the [nim-version](tree/nim-version) branch of this repository. Feel free to fork it, expand upon it, and maybe even finish it. I think a general-purpose embeddable scripting language would be a nice addition to the Nim ecosystem, but I've moved on from using Nim as my main language, so if anybody wants to carry that torch â€“ feel free to do so.
